Hacktrick is a hackathon organized by Dell that took place in Egypt. The hackathon aimed to bring together young innovators and developers to work on real-world challenges and create innovative solutions using technology.
This year the hackathon was about AI, cybercecurity and optimization, the problem in short is that you enter a maze (10*10) at the top left corner and the exit is at bottom right corner inside the maze there are 4 children you want to rescue, to rescue a child you need to solve a riddle and the score depends on the number of children you rescued, how many steps you took, and the time to solve the riddles and there is a rule that if you didn&amp;rsquo;t exit at the bottom right corner you will get only 80% of the score finalyy you have 5 submissions and your best one is taken into account.</description>
